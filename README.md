# MyTime
An Online Punch Clock Leaderboard developed with Meteor.js and Materialize
A working demo can be found at http://mytimeshowcase.meteor.com/

At the company I am working a summer co-op for wanted a way to keep track of our hours.
This company being a startup we could be working from anywhere so it had to be accesible from work and home.
We also wanted it to me a motivational tool, so you would see how many hours the other employees were putting in so you could see how you compared.

I made this to solve those problems and gain some experience with Meteor.js
Also I am a big fan of Material design so I wanted to try Materialize in a web application.
